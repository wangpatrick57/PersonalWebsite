It was both because\n        I liked being a Yearbook photographer and because, since I was a photographer, I had nothing to do in class so I\n        played games with my friend every day. Our favorite game was <i>Test Subject Arena 2</i>, which was a platform fighter\n        with one melee guy, six guys that shoot bullets which go straight, and one guy that throws a ball that rolls and has\n        gravity.<br>\n        <br>\n        I felt like there was so much potential with this game that it hadn't tapped into, considering six of the characters\n        literally did the same thing, so in high school I made my own version of this game. It's a platform fighter based on\n        ranged attacks with various types of projectiles and mobility abilities, quite similar to a MOBA. The video below\n        shows a match between the rogue, who specializes in mobility and precise close range attacks, and the caster, who has\n        the most difficult projectiles to master.\n      </span>\n      <video class=\"demoVid\" controls>\n        <source src=\"../assets/colorsseumDemo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n      </video>\n      <span class=\"orange\">\n        I have been dreaming of making a video game since I was 5, and I've been trying since I was 12. Colorsseum will\n        always hold a special place in my heart because it is the first video game I'd ever finished. I went through two\n        complete redesigns, and in both I rethought my entire ability format as well as my internal projectile and physics\n        systems.<br>\n      </span>\n      <video class=\"demoVid\" controls>\n        <source src=\"../assets/colorsseumGameplay.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n      </video>\n      <span class=\"orange\">\n        Colorsseum started one Friday when I made the mage (the orange one) who could fly by pressing 2 and shoot\n        balls by pressing 1. That was the first version: every character had two keys. After a few months though, I wanted\n        to make the game more dynamic so I added in mouse input. I split characters in \"mouse\" and \"keyboard\" characters;\n        mouse characters had two abilities but had a cursor to work with, while keyboard characters had four abilities.\n        In the end though, I made all the characters into \"keyboard\" ones for consistency, and here we are!<br>\n      </span>\n      <br>\n      <span class=\"orange\">\n        Download the game (and also see the other 2 characters) <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fishgoatman.itch.io/colorsseum\">here!</a>\n      </span>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Tapestry',\n  data () {\n    return {\n      colorsseumPurple: '#FFDBFF'\n    }\n  },\n  created () {\n    const oldTransition = document.body.style.transition\n    document.body.style.transition = 'none'\n    document.body.style.backgroundColor = this.colorsseumPurple\n    /* eslint-disable-next-line */\n    const trash = document.body.offsetHeight\n    document.body.style.transition = oldTransition\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n#bigBoy {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 57vw;\n  background-color: #FFDBFF;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n.writeup .orange {\n  color: #CA9B00;\n}\n.writeup .green {\n  color: #1DB660;\n}\n.writeup .blue {\n  color: #2C95D1;\n}\n.demoVid {\n  display: block;\n  margin: 3vw 0vw;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 48vw;\n  object-fit: contain;\n}\n.link {\n  color: #1DB660;\n}\n.link:hover {\n  color: #CA9B00;\n}\n</style>\n"],"sourceRoot":"src/views"}]}
