It takes months to get proficient at a single character, because there are about 20 different\n        moves every character can do and half of them are different variations of punches. It's definitely a great game\n        and I really enjoy playing Bowser, but it's not a good party game. Colorsseum it basically Smash Bros, but each\n        character has four distinct, easy to use abilities, like a MOBA.<br>\n      </span>\n      <video class=\"demoVid\" controls>\n        <source src=\"../assets/colorsseumDemo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n      </video>\n      <span class=\"orange\">\n        I have been dreaming of making a video game since I was 5, and I've been trying since I was 12. Colorsseum will\n        always hold a special place in my heart because it is the first video game I'd ever finished. I went through two\n        complete redesigns, and in both I rethought my entire ability format as well as my internal projectile and physics\n        systems.<br>\n      </span>\n      <video class=\"demoVid\" controls>\n        <source src=\"../assets/colorsseumGameplay.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\"/>\n      </video>\n      <span class=\"orange\">\n        Colorsseum started one Friday when I made the mage (the orange one) who could fly by pressing 2 and shoot\n        balls by pressing 1. That was the first version: every character had two keys. After a few months though, I wanted\n        to make the game more dynamic so I added in mouse input. I split characters in \"mouse\" and \"keyboard\" characters;\n        mouse characters had two abilities but had a cursor to work with, while keyboard characters had four abilities.\n        In the end though, I made all the characters into \"keyboard\" ones for consistency, and here we are!<br>\n      </span>\n      <br>\n      <span class=\"orange\">\n        Download the game <a class=\"link\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fishgoatman.itch.io/colorsseum\">here</a>\n      </span>\n    </p>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: 'Tapestry',\n  data () {\n    return {\n      colorsseumPurple: '#FFDBFF'\n    }\n  },\n  created () {\n    const oldTransition = document.body.style.transition\n    document.body.style.transition = 'none'\n    document.body.style.backgroundColor = this.colorsseumPurple\n    /* eslint-disable-next-line */\n    const trash = document.body.offsetHeight\n    document.body.style.transition = oldTransition\n    window.scrollTo(0, 0)\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style scoped>\n#bigBoy {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 57vw;\n  background-color: #FFDBFF;\n}\n.writeup {\n  font-size: 3vw;\n  padding: 0 8vw;\n}\n.writeup .orange {\n  color: #CA9B00;\n}\n.writeup .green {\n  color: #1DB660;\n}\n.writeup .blue {\n  color: #2C95D1;\n}\n.demoVid {\n  display: block;\n  margin: 3vw 0vw;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 48vw;\n  object-fit: cover;\n}\n.link {\n  color: #1DB660;\n}\n.link:hover {\n  color: #CA9B00;\n}\n</style>\n"]}]}
